# Discord-pokemon-catcher
Simple python script to catch pokemons on discord from [Toasty bot](https://toastybot.com)

## Install
```
git clone https://github.com/TropicoDebug/Discord-pokemon-catcher.git
cd Discord-pokemon-catcher
pip install requirements.txt
```
> You should install the requirements in a python venv if you already have the official discord package since they use the same name
## How to use
Usage is stupid simple, you just need to put your [discord token](https://www.androidauthority.com/get-discord-token-3149920/) and the [id of the channel](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) where you want to catch pokemons in data.json and then run the script
> Don't forget to remove the quotes for the channel id in data.json since it's an integer
```
python3 main.py
```

PS: using selfbots is not allowed by discord and im not encouraging you to do so
